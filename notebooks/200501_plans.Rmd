# Plan

I'll keep a weekly update on the thesis progress

My tasks:

- Thesis writing: I plan to write them in the following order  
   1. Chapter4 RNA SS prediction: writing the paper-formatted manuscript (intro, method, result, discussion) in 1 week
   2. Chapter5 RNA MRFalign: 1~2 weeks for paper-formatted manuscript
   3. Intro and summary 1~2 weeks


- The MRFalign project: 
   - Main program is implemented, but needs more thorough test/tuning to justify its value.
   - Current test show its alignment is not better than Infernal's CM based model, probably because the tests are based on RFAM, which maybe biased.

# MRFalign project
## Current status

- Benchmarks:
  - Bralibase 2.1 K2, 27 families without pseudoknot, pairwise sequence alignment test
    - Goal: to test the accuracy of aligning low-seqid RNAs
    - Result: MRFalign can generate good alignment for low sequence ID, but not better than CMalign
  -  5 RFAM families with pseudoknot,re-aligned with MRFalign and CMalign 
    - Result: alignment are very close but not better than CMalign
    
## Issues

- RFAM Data may be biased: Tested RFAM families with PK can align the PK regions well due to sequence conservation.It's possible that complicated pseudoknot RNAs cannot be aligned well, therefore not recorded in RFAM.


So how can I prove that MRFalign is better than CMalign at aligning RNA with pseudoknot? 

## Possible plans

- Experiment with synthetic MSA  
    - The goal of using synthetic MSA is to test if MRF models can align PK structures better than CM
    - Plan A
      - Given a pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure, generate MSA (train/test) that satisfies the constraint.  
      - Construct MRF and CM from MSA, align test sequence with MRF and CM model
      - Benchmark the alignment
    - Plan B
      - Start from existing MSA with PK, introduce double mutations to basepairs
      - Construct MRF and CM from MSA, align test sequence with MRF and CM model
      - Benchmark the alignment

- ncRNA (with PK) homolog search with CMalign and MRFalign, 
    - In theory MRFalign should find more candidate homologs
